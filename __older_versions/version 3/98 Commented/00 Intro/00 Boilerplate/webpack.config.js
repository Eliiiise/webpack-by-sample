/*
WEBPACK is a module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. 
When webpack processes your application, it recursively builds a dependency graph,
that includes every module your application needs, then packages all of those modules into one or more bundles.

There are a lot of statements that have been standardized in ES2015. 
Although they are not supported in most browsers yet, webpack does support them out of the box.

Webpack integrated well with transpilers like babel or typescript, they allow us that older browsers can also run it.
